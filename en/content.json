For example in a web socket session, whenever we receive a response from server success or fail would be called depending on the response, however complete would be called only when the session terminates. There are also some very rare scenarios that complete would not be called at all, like those page life cycle events, because once a complete is called the sequence will be terminated, but in those certain scenarios we need to notify those events whenever it happens thus we need to keep it in memory.
